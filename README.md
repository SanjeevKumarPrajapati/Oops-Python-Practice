**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python** is a programming paradigm that organizes code using **classes** and **objects**. It allows for better modularity, code reuse, and abstraction.  Key concepts of OOP in Python include:  * **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. * **Object**: An instance of a class.
